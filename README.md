# DJI Mobile SDK for iOS

## What Is This?

The DJI Mobile SDK enables you to automate your DJI Product. You can control flight, and many subsystems of the product including the camera and gimbal. Using the Mobile SDK, create a customized mobile app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform.

## Get Started Immediately

### SDK Installation with CocoaPods

Since this project has been integrated with [DJI iOS SDK CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/DJI-SDK-iOS) now, please check the following steps to install **DJISDK.framework** using CocoaPods after you downloading this project:

**1.** Install CocoaPods

### Run Sample Code

Developers can [setup the App Key](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html#objective-c-app-key-setup) and run the sample code to see how the DJI Mobile SDK can be used.

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.

## FFmpeg Customization

We have forked the original FFmpeg and added customized features to provide more video frame information including the frame's width and height, frame rate number, etc. These features will help to implement video hardware decoding. 

The SDK Sample Code uses code of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) licensed under the [LGPLv2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) and its source code can be downloaded from this [Github Page](https://github.com/dji-sdk/FFmpeg).

## Video Hardware Decoder Open Source

Please check the [VideoPreviewer](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-iOS/tree/master/Sample%20Code/VideoPreviewer/VideoPreviewer) source code for details.
