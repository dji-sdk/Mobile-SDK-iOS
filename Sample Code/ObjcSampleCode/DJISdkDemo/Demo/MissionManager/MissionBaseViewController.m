/**
 *  This file demonstrates the interaction with DJIMissionManager. The DJIMissionManager uses the singleton pattern. User can
 *  access it by fetching the sharedInstance. Different types of missions can be executed by DJIMissionManager. The missions have 
 *  a common workflow. The basic workflow to execute a mission is as follow:
 *  1. Create an isntance of a specific mission. See initializeMission. 
 *  2. Insert the mission into DJIMissionManager by calling prepareMission:withProgress:withCompletion:. 
 *  3. After DJIMissionManager finishes the preparation, user should call startMissionExecutionWithCompletion: to start the mission. 
 *     The completion block is called after the mission is started. 
 *  4. To keep track of the progress of the mission, user needs to set itself as the delegate of DJIMissionManager. Then the delegate
 *     can receive the updated progress and execution result.
 *  5. During the execution, user can also stop the mission. Some missions can even be paused, resumed or downloaded. 
 *  
 *  MissionBaseViewController includes the basic workflow for DJIMissionManager. A specific mission may have other requried operations.
 *  Those specific operations are implemented in the sub-class of MissionBaseViewController.
