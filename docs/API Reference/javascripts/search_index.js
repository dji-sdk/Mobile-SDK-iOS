While 5 GHz will not necessarily have the same range as 2.4 GHz, it can be useful  if the 2.4 GHz band has a lot of existing interference. However, as some countries do not permit the use of the 5 GHz spectrum, the SDK will automatically try to determine the country in which the product is operating and enable or disable the 5 GHz option accordingly. The process of determining in which country the product is flying uses location information. This method can be used to disable this check, but must  be called before `registerAppWithDelegate` to take effect. If  disabled, only 2.4 GHz will be available as an option.  @param disableCountryCodeCheck `YES` if the country code check is disabled.",

                   "The active track mission operator is the only object that controls, runs and monitors ActiveTrack Missions. It can be accessed from `DJIMissionControl`.  An ActiveTrack Mission allows an aircraft to track a moving subject using the vision system and without a GPS tracker on the subject. To use an ActiveTrack mission:  - Prepare a mission with the rectangle that best represents the  target to track  - Start the mission to initiate tracking of the object and  begin the state updates (DJIMissionProgressStatus)  - At this point, the  aircraft will track the target while hovering in place.  - Give confirmation that the tracked target is correct  with `acceptConfirmationWithCompletion` and the aircraft will begin flying  relative to the target.  - If the tracking algorithm looses sufficient  confidence in tracking the target, then the aircraft will stop flying relative  to the object and either notify the user (through execution state) that the  target is lost or it needs another confirmation that the target is correct.  - If the mission is paused, the aircraft will hover in place, but continue tracking the target by adjusting gimbal pitch and aircraft yaw.  - If mission is resumed, confirmation of tracking rectangle will need to be sent through to  start flying relative to target.  - The mission can be canceled with `stopMissionWithCompletion`  at any time.  - `stopMissionWithCompletion` should also be used to reject tracking confirmation if the camera is tracking the wrong target. After stopping the mission, the mission needs to be recreated with a new rectangle and loaded into the operator.  - The main camera is used to track the target, so gimbal cannot be adjusted during an  ActiveTrack mission.  - During the mission  the aircraft can be manually flown with pitch, roll and throttle. Yaw and gimbal are  automatically controlled to continue tracking the target.  - If the mission is  executing, and after confirmation of the tracking rectangle has been sent, the  aircraft can be manually controlled horizontally similar to a  `DJIFlightOrientationModeHomeLock` where the home is the tracked target. If aircraft  is manually controlled upward, the aircraft will lift and retreat, and if it is  controlled downward, it will go down and get closer to the target.",

To optimize the amount of energy delivered by a battery over its lifetime to a product, batteries should be matched or paired with other batteries of similar full charge capacity. The operational challenges of always using paired batteries can be alleviated using the battery pairing interfaces. This method can then be used to determine if the installed battery combination is a previously assigned pair or not.  @param completion Block that receives the pairing state. @param pairingState Pairing state. @param error Error retrieving the value.",
